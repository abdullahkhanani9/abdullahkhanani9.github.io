## Review Ticket: Week 2

### Week 2:
Me and my partner Sergi, just made our lab notebook and wanted to add as many things as we can before our live review. We also started to play around with the jupyter notebooks, which were very interesting. We were prepared and started to add some hacks like the snake game and calculator markdown file.

### Problems We Faced
This week, me and Sergi were facing a huge problem, our files weren't loading onto our webpage. We loaded up VSCODE multiple times and still didn't solve because our problem was that we were using the "Name_Notebook.md" file instead of making it with a date. After consulting with Mr. Lopez and the helpers, we realized that we didn't use a date in our beginning. Surprisingly, that was our only problem for this week!
