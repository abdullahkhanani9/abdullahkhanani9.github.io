## Review Ticket: Week 4

### Week 4: 
 We got into a team of 4, combing with Ishan and Lincoln. Sergi and I edited some code from ChatGPT for our pair showcase. We worked on our project over the week and were proud of our slight progress. When it got to the weekends, I had plans for my grandma's surgery, while Sergi and Lincoln worked on the project. Ishan didn't do anything over the weekend but helped during the weekdays.

### Problems We Faced This Week
We faced problems with editing and creating our team test video. On top of that, one of my vscode ipynb wasn't loading as well. Thankfully, we faced minor problems this week.
