## Review Ticket: Week 3

### Week 3: 
This week we prepared for our pair showcase. We wanted to get some default code from ChatGPT like a game such as Tetris or a Quiz. We tried to find games but after trying multiple times, it didn't work so we decided to add 2 games. Sergi found a guess the number game and I found an editable Whack-A-Mole game.

### Problems We Faced This Week
We faced the games not working. Sergi and I tried our best to have a working quiz or a working tetris game, but we decided to go with a Whack-A-Mole game and a number guessing game. Surprisingly, we didn't have any problems with our VSCODE this 
week! 

### Below are the screenshots of the before and after of our edited games
