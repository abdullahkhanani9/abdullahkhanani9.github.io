## Week 5 Review Ticket

### What We Did
- This week we worked on our Web Development test. Ishan Lincoln Sergi and I worked on the hacks and practiced to present them. We input and ran the code and made sure we were prepared.

### Issues for this week
First, we had an issue in where some of our running code wasn't disposing our preferred output. After "swapping" the links on js with HTML the expected output of "switched" wasn't appearing. We added a missing piece of code to resolve our issues. Lincoln and I had issues with our teacher repository not updating the new files, we tried committing and pulling, which fortunately worked for me but Lincoln had to create a new teacher repository.
